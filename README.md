Package Manager... Manager (`pmm`) is a Go (Golang) module that allows you to run some basic operations with several package managers such as Apt, RPM, PIP, and Apk (Alpine not Android).

**Note: This package is pre-1.0 thus the API is still changing as I prepare it for a v1.0 release.**


## Usage

Instructions coming soon.
For now, just look at the code.


## Development

This library is written and tested with Go v1.15+ in mind.
`go fmt` is your friend.
Please feel free to open Issues and PRs as you see fit.
Any PR that requires a good amount of work or is a significant change, it would be best to open an Issue to discuss the change first.
